# KomischesCAIPProjekt
CAIP 3 Benotetes Projekt

## Features
##### Basics
- Open common image formats
- Have multiple images open simultaniously, _switch_ between active images with _Left-Click_. **Open** an image viewer with **Right-Click**
- Generate multiple sample images (graygradient, noise, perlinnoise)
- Save any generated image to disk
##### Processing
- Histogram function (color and grayscale)
- Basic image manipulation (Rotate, Resize, Crop, Invert)
- Conversion to grayscale
- Gamma correction
- Contrast adjustment
- Binarising grayscale images (single threshold, double threshold, adaptive)
- Multiple Morphology options (Erode, dilate, open, close, gradient)
- Filtering (Mean, Median, Gauss, Edge)
##### Other
- Magnifier window with multiple "zoom" levels
- Option to measure elapsed time for all operations

_Please note that the custom filter mask option - while already implemented - does not work and still needs some love._
